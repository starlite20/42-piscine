## 42 Abu Dhabi Piscine Workfiles

This repository contains my completed work files and exercises from the **Piscine**, specifically covering the foundational modules from **C00 to C09**.

This project was completed by me within a month and served as an intensive introduction to the **C programming language** and the fundamental concepts of computing and software development.

### 📚 Project Overview

The initial phase of the Piscine emphasizes command of the Unix environment followed by a deep dive into the C language, starting from the basics and progressing toward dynamic memory and complex data types.

| Module | Focus Area | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shell00** | Basic Shell Commands | `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`, file manipulation, basic I/O redirection. |
| **Shell01** | Advanced Shell Scripting | Variables, quoting, environment variables, creating simple bash scripts. |
| **C00** | Basic I/O & Functions | `printf`, `write`, character handling, basic C functions. |
| **C01** | Pointers & Variables | Pointer usage, dereferencing, variable manipulation via pointers. |
| **C02** | Strings & Arrays | String manipulation, array indexing, memory representation of strings. |
| **C03** | String Comparisons | Implementing string comparison functions (`strcmp`, etc.) without standard library. |
| **C04** | Advanced I/O & Types | Recursion, hexadecimal/octal conversion, advanced printing. |
| **C05** | Algorithms & Recursion | Factorials, Fibonacci, prime numbers, mathematical algorithms using recursion and iteration. |
| **C06** | Shell Commands in C | Command-line argument handling (`argc`, `argv`), basic executable creation. |
| **C07** | Memory Allocation | Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`), managing arrays and strings in the heap. |
| **C08** | Function Pointers | Introduction to function pointers, passing functions as arguments, creating function arrays. |
| **C09** | Library Creation | Creating static and dynamic libraries (`.a` files) to organize and reuse functions. |

### 🛠️ Skills Gained

Completing these modules within the month-long period provided an intense and comprehensive learning experience. The primary skills developed include:

#### 1. C Programming Fundamentals
* **Manual Memory Management:** Proficient use of **pointers** and **dynamic memory allocation** (`malloc`, `free`) to manage data on the heap.
* **Low-Level String Handling:** Deep understanding of how strings are represented and manipulated in memory, including implementing core C string functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`) without relying on the standard C library (`<string.h>`).
* **Function Pointers:** Ability to use **function pointers** for creating flexible and reusable code structures.
* **Library Management:** Skill in compiling and organizing C functions into **static libraries** (C09).
* **Recursion & Iteration:** Strong grasp of both recursive and iterative approaches to solve algorithmic problems (e.g., Fibonacci, Factorial).

#### 2. Unix/Command Line Proficiency
* **Shell Scripting:** Competency in writing and executing **Shell scripts (Bash)** for automation and file manipulation (Shell00, Shell01).
* **Command Line Arguments:** Skill in parsing and utilizing **command-line arguments** (`argc`, `argv`) to make C programs interactive (C06).
* **File System Navigation:** Comfortable working in a **Unix environment**, navigating file systems, and managing files and permissions.

#### 3. Development Workflow & Methodology
* **Git Version Control:** Effective use of **Git** for tracking changes, committing work, and managing the project repository.
* **Rigorous Testing:** Developing a disciplined approach to **self-testing** and debugging code to meet strict function prototypes and output requirements.
* **Autonomous Problem Solving:** The ability to independently research, analyze, and solve complex programming challenges with minimal external assistance, which is core to the 42 methodology.
